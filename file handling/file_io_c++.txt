File handling in c++

To work with file we use three classes 

*header file <fstream>
	1.fstreambase
	2.ifstream	--> use to get the value from file. This class derived from fstreambase
	3.ofstream	--> use to put the value to file. This class is also derived from fstreambase

*To open the the file there are two ways :

	1. using the constructor
	2. using the member function open() of the class

*getline() : to scan the full data of file 

*TO close the file we can use close() of the class


This is enough info. to get to know about file handling.
